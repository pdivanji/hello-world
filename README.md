# hello-world
This is not my first program of life...It's just another beginning to start using Github with programming languages such as Python, Go, etc.
I had about 10 years of experience in coding using RPGILE, CL, AS400 and Embedded SQL programming. Also, I did good amount of database programming using PL/SQL, Embedded SQL in RPG, MySQL, etc. Then I moved into Program management and later in product management to work with engineering to develop new products and enhance user experience on existing ones.
